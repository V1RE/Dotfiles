# My dotfiles

I've set up my dotfiles in such a way, that you can manage them using the `config` command. It's just an alias for git, but using another folder as the bare repository.

## Installation

To install my dotfiles, run the following command:

```sh
curl -Lks https://cutt.ly/Lfd0K8N | /bin/bash
```

## Programs

- ZSH
- Node (install with nvm)
- Lazygit
- Lsd
